decided to take break from academics study and solved a string question from hacker rank

question : In this challenge, the user enters a string and a substring. You have to print the number of times that the substring occurs in the given string. String traversal will take place from left to right, not from right to left.
solution by me:
def count_substring(string, sub_string):
    total_count = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        f = string[i:len(sub_string)+i]
        if f == sub_string:
            total_count+=1
    return total_count
    
        

if __name__ == '__main__':
    string = input().strip()
    sub_string = input().strip()
    
    count = count_substring(string, sub_string)
    print(count)
