Learnt bubble sort.
The motive concept behind that is to just swap the numbers in a nested loop

Example solved by me
def sort(num):
    for i in range(len(num)-1,0,-1):
        for j in range(i):
            if num[j]>num[j+1]:                
                temp = num[j]
                num[j] = num[j+1]
                num[j+1] = temp
                
               
               
num=[3,7,1,0,56,45,9]
print(sort(num))
print(num)
